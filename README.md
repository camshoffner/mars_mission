# Mission to Mars 

## Objective
A web app is created to assist in scraping multiple Mars sites and compiling in one location. Using Splinter, BeautifulSoup, and Flask, a new site is created to display the collected information and pictures.

## Process
For this web app, four sites were scraped for images, news articles and fact tables. The components were saved in a NoSQL database (Mongo), and then pulled into html code.  The website uses Bootstrap to organize the data.
